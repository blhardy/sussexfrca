Sodium Chloride 0.9% is the only solution that should be used, but there has been a National Patient Safety Alert due to this error leading to insulin being repeatedly given inappropriately. The patient may have a slight increase in glucose level due to sepsis both the capillary and arterial line glucose would be similar. There is no reason why the patient would have developed diabetes, and the capillary glucose measurement is normal. There is no evidence of gas analyser error and an unclean finger tip usually leads to a higher reading (rather than lower).",The arterial line pressure transducer has erroneously been run through with Glucose 5% instead of Sodium Chloride 0.9%,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE
