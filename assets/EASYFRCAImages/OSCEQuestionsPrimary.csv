Communication,Awareness,,You have been asked to speak to a 55 year old lady who is awaiting surgery for a diagnostic laparoscopy. She is concerned that she will be aware of what is happening during the operation because her daughter had an episode of awareness during an emergency caesarean section last year. How would you begin the conversation? What more information would you want to obtain from the patient?,"Begin the conversation by introducing yourself, confirming the identity of the patient and the reason for the discussion. Establish what the concerns of the patient are and then proceed to address each concern. Acknowledge that the risk of awareness is increased in emergency obstetric anaesthesia due to many factors,  but the risk of awareness during elective surgery is much lower. I would ask the patient about her specific concerns, previous awareness, the details of her daughters emergency caesarean section, chronic medication or alcohol use risk factors of awareness like obesity.  ",,, What factors increase the risk of awareness? What is the risk of awareness under anaesthesia for this case? How would you adjust your anaesthetic practice to minimise the risk of awareness?,"Patient factors: obesity, female, chronic drug or alcohol use. Surgical factors: emergency, trauma, cardiac surgery, obstetric. Anaesthetic: neuromuscular blockers, TIVA, lack of EEG, low MAC. The risk of awareness for this case is around 1:9000 because a neuromuscular blocker is likely to be used. If no NMB is used then the risk is 1:19000.",,,This patient alerts you to the fact that she suffers from motion sickness. What factors are associated with increased risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting? How would you reduce the risk of post-operative nausea and vomiting?,"Factors are: female sex, travel sickness, previous PONV, long operation, children, nitrous oxide, volatile agents and opioid use. The risk of PONV can be reduced using TIVA, minimising opioid use, giving dexamethasone, giving other anti-emetics,  avoiding the precipitating factors and by using regional anaesthesia. ",,,,,
Communication,Post-op Pain,,You have been asked to speak to a patient's son about his post-operative pain. He had an emergency laparotomy yesterday and his post-operative pain was managed using an epidural and you were called to see him 2 hours after going to the ward in order to give a top-up due to a missed segment. The pain had disappeared 20 minutes later. How would you explain this post-operative pain to his son? How would explain this temporary failure of the epidural to the son?,"A well working epidural would provide good regional anaesthesia for a laparotomy post-operatively and has been associated with reduced post-operative mortality and opioid use. They have their own risks hypotension, : abscess, haematoma, nerve damage and failure. It is important to explain to the son that this was a major emergency operation and pain is to be expected post-operatively. There is no perfect way to manage this pain but the epidural has been working well since your intervention. I would apologise for the painful period before it began working, but it is unlikely that anything could have been done to prevent this. ",,,What was the reason for inserting an epidural? What are the side effects of epidural anaesthesia? What are the alternatives to epidurals?,"The epidural has multiple benefits for major abdominal surgery: reduced post-operative pain, reduced opioid usage, reduced mortality, reduced risk of post-operative pneumonia, earlier mobilisation, reduced rate of VTE.
